"""
Emails students who have assignment(s) due within the next 24 hours
that they have not yet submitted.

Each student receives ONE email listing all their due-soon assignments,
not one email per assignment. This keeps volume under Gmail limits and
avoids sending the same person several separate reminders.

Run manually:      python manage.py remind_due_assignments
Dry run (no send): python manage.py remind_due_assignments --dry-run

Scheduled daily via Windows Task Scheduler.
