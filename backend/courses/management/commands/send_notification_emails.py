"""
Send notification emails that have not gone out yet.

Run it from Windows Task Scheduler alongside remind_due_assignments:

    python manage.py send_notification_emails

Every run takes the pending queue in batches over ONE SMTP connection. The
work used to happen inline in whichever request created the Notification,
which meant a bulk operation like generate_exam_fees did one authenticated
Gmail connection per student before it could return.
